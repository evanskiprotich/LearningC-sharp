    // File Handling

    // C# provides us with a number of classes to work with files.

    // File, StreamWriter and StreamReader classes.
    // All three classes are available in the System.IO namespace.

    // Note that we have to use double slashes \\ when writing the path. 
    // This is because if we only use a single slash, the compiler will think the single slash is
    // the beginning of an escape sequence and interpret \m as an escape sequence.
    // This will result in an error.

    // The using keyword here ensures that the Dispose() method is always called.
    // The Dispose() method is a pre-written method in the System namespace that
    // closes or releases any unmanaged resources such as files and streams once theycare no longer needed.
    // It is good practice to always use the using keyword whenever you are dealing with files.

    // EndOfStream is a property of the StreamReader class that returns true when the end of the file is reached.
    // sr.ReadLine() reads a line from the text file and returns it as a string.
    // You should always close your file once you no longer need it. -- sr.Close();

            //StreamWriter sw1 = new StreamWriter(path);

            // When we create the StreamWriter instance, the constructor looks for the file at the given path.If the file is not found, it creates the file.
            // After we instantiate our StreamWriter object, we can start writing to our file using the WriteLine() method as shown below:
            //sw.WriteLine("It is easy to write to a file.");
            // After we finish writing to the file, we have to close the file by writing
            //sw.Close();
            // Note that when you write to a text file, it is also good practice to enclose your code in a using statement.

            //Writing to the file
